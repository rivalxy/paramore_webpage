      <h2>MUSIC STYLE</h2>
      <p>
        Paramore's music style has generally been regarded as alternative rock,
        pop punk, pop rock, power pop, emo pop, emo, pop, and new wave. Joshua
        Martin had written after an interview with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayley_Williams" target="_blank"
          >Hayley Williams</a
        >
        , "The band isn't just a short pop-punk girl with red hair and a spunky
        attitude. Their music is like them, it's aged differently. It's sped up,
        and slowed down. It's emo without being whiny, or bratty. Almost a very
        literal anti-Avril Lavigne."Alternative Press magazine had commented
        that the band was "young-sounding", while consistently being
        "honest."Paramore's first album All We Know is Falling had an arguably
        more "formulaic pop-punk" sound that was "delivered particularly well"
        and the combination of the two had created a "refined rock infused
        pop/punk album."The band's second release, Riot! was said to explore a
        'diverse range of styles," however, not straying far from "their
        signature sound."The band's later albums, such as Paramore and After
        Laughter, included more of a new wave and synth-pop sound.

      <h2>BAND HISTORY</h2>
      <p>
        The group released its debut album All We Know Is Falling in 2005, with
        the album reaching number four on the UK Rock Chart in 2009 and number
        thirty on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart in 2006.
        <br />
        The band's second album, Riot!, was released in 2007. Due to the success
        of the singles "Misery Business", "Crushcrushcrush", and "That's What
        You Get", Riot! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in
        the United States. They then received a Best New Artist nomination at
        the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is the
        band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on
        the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first week sales. It produced the
        top-forty single "The Only Exception" and went platinum in Ireland and
        the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
        <br />
        Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released
        their self-titled fourth album in 2013. It gave the band their first
        number one on the US Billboard 200 and was also the number one album in
        the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina
        and Mexico. It included the singles "Still Into You" and "Ain't It Fun",
        with the latter winning
        <a href="https://www.grammy.com" target="_blank">the Grammy Award</a>
        for Best Rock Song for Hayley Williams and Taylor York as songwriters,
        making it Paramore's first Grammy win. The band's lineup changed once
        again after this album cycle with bassist Jeremy Davis leaving the band
        near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in
        2017. Their fifth studio album, After Laughter, was released later that
        year.
